### Major Update: Emotion-First Messaging & Hybrid Architecture

#### üéØ Strategic Changes

- **What Changed:** 
  - Transformed all headlines to lead with feelings and emotional outcomes

  - Changed CTAs from functional ("Reserve Housing") to emotional ("Start Your Journey Home")

**Key Message Changes:**
- Hero: Kept original "Transitional Housing for Veterans..." per client request, maintaining professional credibility
- Tagline: "Where Healing Begins and Hope Flourishes" - focuses on outcomes not services
- Programs Section: "Your Journey to Healing Starts Here" instead of "Featured Programs"
- About Us: "We See You. We Believe in You" instead of generic description
- Admissions: "Your First Step Toward Peace" instead of "How It Works"
- Contact: "We're Waiting to Welcome You" instead of "Contact Us"

**Program-Specific Emotional Messaging:**
- **Veterans:** "You protected us. Now let us protect you" - acknowledges service, offers reciprocal care
- **Recovery:** "You've fought the hardest battle of your life. Now feel the relief of not fighting alone" - validates struggle
